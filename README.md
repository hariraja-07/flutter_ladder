## Work in Progress

- Added **Hello Flutter** module as the starting point.  
- Building a **workspace** (editor + instructions + output preview).  
- Tried using an API to interpret Dart code â€” blocked by **CORS issues**.  
- Now experimenting with a **lite homemade Dart interpreter** instead.  
- Connected **code editor â†’ run button â†’ output**, seems to be working.  
- Not sure exactly where this project will go, but excited to find out.  
- Stay tuned ðŸ™‚
